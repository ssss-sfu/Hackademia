                        Environmental Science is an undergraduate program that fosters critical thinking about 
                        how the world works and teaches students to use science to resolve environmental problems.

                    Students complete their program with an EVSC ‘capstone’ course in their final year, 
                    where they apply what they’ve learned during their studies to a collaborative group research project on a real-world environmental problem.
